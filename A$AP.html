<p style="color:black;"> Delhi Metro is one of the advanced metro systems in the world and it is the largest
 metro system in India. The Delhi Metro is a mass rapid transit system serving Delhi and its
 satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Bahadurgarh and Ballabgarh, in
 the National Capital Region of India. The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines serving
 255 stations with a total length of 348.12 kilometres </p> <br>

 On the cold silver seates
 of the Delhi Metro,
 
 
 (reserved for women
 and senior citizens)
 our comfort is rude.
 
 
 You giggle at the futility
 of the sophisticated bi-lingual <del> woman </del> <ins> human </ins> 
 lecturing the crowd 
 on morals and precautions.
 
 
 I stare at my knee,
 where you've written your name
 somewhere, with your finger.
